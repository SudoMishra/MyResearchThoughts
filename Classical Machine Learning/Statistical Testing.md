A practical guide to common statistical tests used in hypothesis testing, experiment analysis, and ML evaluation. Each category is linked to a corresponding note using Obsidian-style backlinks.

| **Category**                       | **Purpose / Use Case**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [[T-Test]]                         | Compare means between two groups (e.g., A/B testing, control vs treatment)            |
| [[Paired T-Test]]                 | Compare means of two related groups (e.g., before-after test on same subjects)        |
| [[ANOVA]]                          | Compare means of 3 or more groups (e.g., effectiveness of multiple teaching methods)  |
| [[Chi-Square Test]]                | Test independence between two categorical variables (e.g., gender vs preference)      |
| [[F-Test]]                         | Compare variances between two populations (used in ANOVA or model selection)          |
| [[Z-Test]]                         | Compare sample and population means when variance is known and sample size is large   |
| [[Mann-Whitney U Test]]            | Non-parametric test to compare two independent groups (alternative to T-test)         |
| [[Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test]]      | Non-parametric test for two related samples (alternative to Paired T-test)            |
| [[Kruskal-Wallis Test]]            | Non-parametric ANOVA alternative for comparing 3+ independent groups                  |
| [[Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test]]        | Test if a sample follows a specific distribution (e.g., normality check)              |
| [[Shapiro-Wilk Test]]              | Test for normality in a sample (suitable for small datasets)                          |
| [[Levene's Test]]                  | Check homogeneity of variances across groups (important for ANOVA assumptions)        |
| [[Pearson Correlation Test]]       | Test linear relationship strength between two continuous variables                    |
| [[Spearman Correlation Test]]      | Rank-based correlation test (non-parametric)                                          |
| [[Bootstrapping]]                  | Estimate confidence intervals via resampling without assuming a distribution          |
| [[Permutation Test]]               | Evaluate significance by shuffling labels or outcomes (distribution-free testing)     |
