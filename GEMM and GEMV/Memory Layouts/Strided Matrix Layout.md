**What is a Stride?**  
- **Stride Definition:**  
  In computer memory, data is often stored in contiguous blocks. However, sometimes data is stored with a “stride,” which means that successive elements (or rows/columns) are separated by a fixed number of memory locations rather than being back-to-back. The stride is the step size (in memory addresses or elements) you must move to go from one element (or row/column) to the next.

**Strided Layouts in Context**  
- **For Vectors in gemv:**  
  - Vectors might not always be stored contiguously. For example, you might have a vector that is a column of a matrix or a subvector extracted from a larger array. In these cases, the elements are not necessarily next to each other in memory; they are separated by a fixed number of elements (the stride).
  - The `gemv` routine can be designed to understand and handle these strides. It uses the stride information to correctly access each element of the vector, even if they are not contiguous in memory.

- **For Matrices in gemm:**  
  - The typical implementation of `gemm` assumes a certain regularity in the matrix layout (like pure row-major or column-major order) where the data for each row or column is stored contiguously. This makes the multiplication algorithm much more efficient because it can predict memory access patterns and optimize cache usage.
  - Supporting arbitrary strided access for matrices (where, for example, rows or columns might have gaps or padding between them) adds extra complexity to the algorithm. This is why many `gemm` implementations assume a standard contiguous layout, as it simplifies both the implementation and optimization strategies.

**Why Does This Matter?**  
- **Performance Implications:**  
  - When a routine like `gemv` supports strided vectors, it can be used more flexibly in situations where data isn’t stored in a “neat” contiguous block. This can be particularly useful in high-performance computing where data might be a subpart of a larger dataset.
  - On the other hand, the lack of support for arbitrary strided layouts in `gemm` means that the library expects you to organize your matrix data in a standard layout. This design decision allows for more aggressive optimizations (like blocking and cache optimization) that are key to high-performance matrix-matrix multiplication.

- **Interface Complexity:**  
  - By having these distinctions, the library provides a clearer and more efficient interface for both kinds of operations. Users need to be aware of the memory layout of their data and choose the appropriate function (`gemv` for vectors with potential strides and `gemm` for matrices in contiguous formats) to ensure optimal performance.


- **Why Strides Occur:**
    
    - **Submatrices/Subarrays:** When you work with a submatrix extracted from a larger matrix, the data for the submatrix might not be stored contiguously in memory, resulting in a stride.
        
    - **Padding:** In some cases, memory alignment or performance optimizations introduce padding between rows or columns.
        
    - **Non-standard Storage:** Some applications might store matrices in a non-contiguous manner to accommodate specific access patterns or to interleave other data.
### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Access:**  
    When a matrix is stored with a stride, the distance between successive elements in a row or column is greater than one. This non-contiguous access can negatively impact cache performance because it may result in more cache misses compared to a contiguous layout.
    
- **Algorithm Adaptation:**  
    Algorithms that are designed to operate on strided data must correctly account for these gaps. Many numerical libraries allow you to specify the stride so that the routine accesses the correct elements.
