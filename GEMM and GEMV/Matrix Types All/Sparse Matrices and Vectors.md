**Key Characteristics:**  
Sparse matrices or vectors have a large number of zero entries. Directly applying dense algorithms wastes both time (performing unnecessary multiplications by zero) and memory.

**Optimizations:**  
- **Specialized Storage Formats:**  
  Formats such as Compressed Sparse Row (CSR), Compressed Sparse Column (CSC), and others allow storage of only nonzero elements along with their indices. This reduces memory usage significantly.
  
- **Algorithmic Improvements:**  
  Multiplication routines (e.g., sparse BLAS libraries) are designed to iterate only over nonzero elements. This can turn an \( O(n^2) \) or \( O(n^3) \) operation into something much more efficient, especially when the density of nonzero elements is very low.
  
- **Graph and Network Algorithms:**  
  Often, sparse matrices arise in graph problems, where additional insights (like using breadth-first search or other graph-based methods) can further optimize computations.
