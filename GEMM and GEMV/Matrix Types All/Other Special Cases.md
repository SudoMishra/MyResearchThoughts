**Symmetric/Hermitian Matrices:**  
- **Properties:**  
  These matrices satisfy \( A = A^T \) (or \( A = A^* \) for complex matrices), meaning only half the matrix needs to be stored.
  
- **Optimizations:**  
  Many libraries provide routines that take advantage of this property to reduce computational workload (for example, only processing the upper or lower triangular part) and memory usage.

**Orthogonal/Unitary Matrices:**  
- **Properties:**  
  These matrices preserve norms and are often represented implicitly (for example, via Householder reflectors).
  
- **Optimizations:**  
  Multiplications involving these matrices can be optimized by avoiding explicit formation of the full matrix and using compact representations.

**Low-Rank Approximations:**  
- **Properties:**  
  Some matrices can be approximated well by a product of two much smaller matrices.
  
- **Optimizations:**  
  Techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), CUR decompositions, or randomized low-rank approximation can be used to reduce the effective size of the matrix and speed up computations like matrix multiplication or solving linear systems.
