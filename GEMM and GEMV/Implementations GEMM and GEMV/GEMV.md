**General Matrix Vector GEMV**
  In mathematics, multiplying a matrix by a vector is a special case of multiplying two matrices. For example, if you have an \( m x n \) matrix \( A \) and an \( n \)-dimensional vector \( x \), you can view \( x \) as an \( n x 1 \) matrix. The result is an \( m x 1 \) matrix (or vector).
